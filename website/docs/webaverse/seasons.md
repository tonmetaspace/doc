Seasons represent themed groups of LAND that are designed then rolled out periodically to allow for the intuitive and engaging discovery of user-generated content.

Around every 10 weeks, the street expands with a new section that brings new neighborhoods, [parcels](./parcels), features, and new NFTs.

The street is the chain while each season is a block. Walking down the street is like walking through the blockchain history of Webaverse.

Creating content directly on the street requires a special permit to ensure builds meet a certain spec to guarantee a quality experience for the overworld. Users who own a parcel do not need a permit to deploy content in their linked virtual spaces.
