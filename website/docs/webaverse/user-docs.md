## What is Webaverse?

Webaverse is an MMO which is brought alive by NFTs.
We are working towards making the best rendition of the metaverse. We want to create the metaverse so that it is open, fun and interoperable. We have a strong belief that the metaverse should not be owned or influenced by the big, nasty corporations…...so we decided to make it ourselves.This document will help you get started and experience this platform first hand.
