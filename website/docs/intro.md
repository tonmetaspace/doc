<h1 align="center"><b>Welcome To Webaverse</b></h1>

Wouldn't it be great to have a 100% open source web3 metaverse engine that anyone can host; an engine that could shift the power from a few big tech companies to users and creators? And what if it could load any NFT from the dWeb with slick avatar rigging for AR/VR and much more? We thought it would be kind of cool. So, we made it.

## What is Webaverse?

Webaverse is an open source web3 metaverse game engine that anyone can host. It runs in the browser, utilizes open tools and standards like ThreeJS and NodeJS and is super easy to use.
