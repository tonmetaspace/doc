title: Export Multiple Animations
---

This guide explains how you can export your content from Blender with multiple animations.

## Prerequisites
- Have a blender file with multiple animations

From the [Blender documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.80/addons/io_scene_gltf2.html#animation):

> glTF allows multiple animations per file, with animations targeted to particular objects at time of export. To ensure that an animation is included, either (a) make it the active Action on the object, (b) create a single-strip NLA track, or (c) stash the action.
