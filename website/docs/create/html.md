> Note: HTML NFTs are an experimental early release feature, things may change

For much of the creative web's existence, artists that can code create things that advertise their skills for client work. HTML NFTs offer a new way for technical creators to monetize by minting their unique web art on the blockchain. They are represented as screens in the virtual world.

Currently the easiest way to mint a website on Webaverse is through the web UI on https://webaverse.com/mint. You can upload the file or Github URL to the directory.
