This guide explains how you can export your MagicaVoxels creations by exporting as a `.vox`

Download MagicaVoxel here: https://ephtracy.github.io/

## 1. Export your Voxels as a `.vox` file

To export your model, you can either:

1. Click the "Save Project as" button at the top right of the program
2. Go to export on the bottom right and click `vox`.

## 2. Mint your `.vox` file as an NFT

You can drag and drop the .vox file into Discord with a `.mint` message for the [NFT Discord Bot](https://webaverse.com/discordbot) to tokenize the file or upload to [mint](https://webaverse.com/mint).

See [How To Mint NFTs](./mint.md) for more details on how to mint the `.vox` file you exported above.
