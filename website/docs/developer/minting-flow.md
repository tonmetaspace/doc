This is what happens when a user uploads a file to a Webaverse interface be minted as a NFT.


1. User logs into website through Metamask, Discord, or Email or joins a Discord server with the [NFT bot](/docs/webaverse/discord-bot).
2. Uploads files to minting interface (jpg, png, gif, mp3, mp4, webm, glb, VRM, WBN)
3. The content uploads to IPFS. Webaverse runs its own pinning server.

After minting, the preview server captures a preview of the NFT and generates a trading card format. To learn more see [preview flow](/docs/developer/preview-flow).
