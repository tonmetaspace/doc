# WSRTC - Quick Start Guide

## Introduction

WSRTC (WebSockets RealTime Communication) is part of a multi-room system that uses binary websocket messages to transfer zjs state across the network. Combined with the World and Universe systems, that's how multiplayer data is updated within the App.

Wsrtc also uses web codecs to perform voice encoding and decoding and as well as some spectrum analysis for doing things like animating the mouth flaps of the avatar/rig.
