There's also a VR mode in the works, powered by the [WebXR API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/), to deliver the experience through a web browser. This is where the full IK system really shines for players to embody their avatars.

## Usernames and Accounts

Usernames can be set on your account and is stored on-chain in the Webaverse sidechain. There's no initial wallet setup needed, when you enter a Discord server that has the Webaverse bot you're automatically assigned an Ethereum address. The unique address helps keep track of who each person is and who owns what.

## FAQ

Avatars are audiovisual representations of a user.

Walk around as a 2D meme, become a couch, or a shader.

### Where Can I Find Avatars?

The largest public hub of VRM avatars can be found at <a href="https://hub.vroid.com/en/models" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hub.vroid.com</a>, which can be used to find avatars for your use. Be sure to double check the conditions of use first. If unsure, import the avatar as a non-transferrable NFT to be safe.

There are other sources for VRMs such as [Cryptoavatars](https://cryptoavatars.io), [Meebits](https://docs.webaverse.com/docs/create/import-meebit), and soon [ReadyPlayer.me](https://readyplayer.me/avatar). Public avatars are also coming soon to the Webaverse world and menu system.
