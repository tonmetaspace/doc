> Note: The Twitter Bot is still in development and is highly experimental. We're [hiring](https://www.notion.so/webaverse/Webaverse-is-Hiring-8fb49c069c2f450f93ebb911149f21bd) developers interested in these tools to help us build them. Here's the [source code](https://github.com/webaverse/ethereum-bot/blob/master/twitterBot.js) if interested in learning more about it.

The Twitter Bot allows anyone to manage their profile, items inventory, avatar, and create just by sending tweets and messages in Twitter.

You can interact the Webaverse Twitter Bot by tweeting `@cryptotestbot1` and then the command you want to send.

The Twitter Bot runs on an Ethereum side-chain and allows you to interact with the blockchain by running commands on Twitter like `inventory`. Thereâ€™s no setup required, anybody on Twitter will already have an Ethereum address with the bot.
