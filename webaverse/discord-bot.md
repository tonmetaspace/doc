The Discord Bot is the easiest way to mint and trade NFTs. It allows anyone to manage their profile, items inventory, avatar, and create just by uploading files and typing commands into Discord.

Thereâ€™s no user setup required, anybody in the server the bot is invited to will have a Webaverse Ethereum address generated for them. The Discord Bot runs on an Ethereum sidechain which makes transactions nearly instant and cost nothing.

You can interact the Webaverse Discord Bot by inviting it to your Discord server [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=758956702669209611&permissions=0&scope=bot) or you can interact with the bot by joining the [Webaverse Discord](https://discord.gg/3byWubumSa) server. First command you should try is `.help`.

This guide will walk you step-by-step to setting up your Webaverse profile. You will need a Discord account to continue. In the near future we will add support for email and metamask login.

You will set up your own avatar, name, and log into the Webaverse world for the first time!

## Login to the Website

1. Join the [Webaverse Discord](https://discord.gg/R5wqYhvv53)

1. Join the [Webaverse Discord](https://discord.gg/R5wqYhvv53)

2. Type `.mint 1` in the Discord comment

The Discord Bot should respond with the id of the token and file hash:

3. Run `.avatar` + token id
The token id will be what the Discord Bot responded with in step #2, in this case it was 15.
